## II. Synopsis:
This project is on the building, playtesting, and delivering of an idle medieval-themed game loosely based on the idle game Melvor Idle. This idle game will include various components of gameplay such as an idle combat system, crafting, inventory, leveling system, skill mechanism, and world map. 

## III. Three components of complexity:
The first component of complexity is implementing the game mechanics in java using the visual studio code environment on Windows OS. This is where the backend of the project will be built and where the various basis of the mechanisms of the game developed. 

The second component of the complexity is the frontend component and the implementation of a game GUI. This component will also include the creation of assets used for the game.

The third component of complexity is the quality assurance and playtesting segment, where the preliminary versions of the product will be analyzed, scrutinized, improved, and quality assured. Finding bugs and fixing them if possible will also be included in this component.
