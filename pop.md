# Project Overview Proposal

## I. Team Details
Team Name: B.A.D. (B.A.D. at Development) at Development team

Team Members:
* Muhammed Abushamma
* Adrien Abbey
* Luke Davidson
* Brandon Walker

## II. Synopsis
This project is focused on creating an fantasy idle game loosely inspired by Melvor Idle and Kingdom of Loathing. This idle game will include various components of gameplay such as an idle combat system, player progression, saving/loading, and world map. Some stretch goals include crafting, inventory, a leveling system, and skill mechanisms.

## III. Main Components
The core of this project will be written in Java using Visual Studio Code.

### UI
> Luke Davidson
The UI will include a main menu, character load and save menus, a world map, town map, character status menu, and a combat interface.  Additional UI elements will be added or adjusted as needed.

### Idle Combat
> Brandon Walker
The core of this project is an idle combat loop.  Selecting a dungeon (from the world map) determines which enemies the player encounters (and thus the difficulty of combat).  The player then encounters enemies and engages in combat automatically with limited to no player interaction required.  The lack of user interaction is an intentional design decision.

### Supporting Systems
> Adrien Abbey
These are all features which enhance the idle combat system, including monster design, dungeon design (which determines difficulty of enemies), equipment, and upgrades.  Initially these will be very simple, but additional enhancements and new features will be included if time permits.

### Documentation
> Muhammed Abushamma
Documentation is important, apparently.
