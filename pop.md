## II. Synopsis
This project involves building, playtesting, and delivering an idle medieval-themed game loosely based on the idle game Melvor Idle **(did we collectively decide that to be our central inspiration?)**. This idle game will include various components of gameplay such as an idle combat system, ~~crafting~~ (stretch-goal), ~~inventory~~ (stretch-goal), leveling system **(nothing hinting at this in documentation yet)**, skill mechanisms **(again, no documentation)**, and world map.

## III. Three components of complexity
> Note: Should this be *implementation* complexity, or *separation of complexity*, such that we have enough work to split among group members?  Documentation complexity should probably also be included here.

The first component of complexity is implementing the game mechanics in Java using a Visual Studio Code environment ~~on Windows OS~~ **(Linux is a *far* superior OS. Fight me.)**. This is where the backend of the project will be built and where the various basis of the mechanisms of the game developed. 

The second component of the complexity is the frontend component and the implementation of a game GUI. This component will also include the creation of assets used for the game.  **(isn't this also Java?  It really isn't seperate so much as a distinction)**

The third component of complexity is the quality assurance and playtesting segment, where the preliminary versions of the product will be analyzed, scrutinized, improved, and quality assured. Finding bugs and fixing them if possible will also be included in this component.  **(Having a functional project is *not* a requirement for this course.  I'm inclined to put more emphasis on stretch-goals than balance, as that might help sell our "product" better on resumes.)**
