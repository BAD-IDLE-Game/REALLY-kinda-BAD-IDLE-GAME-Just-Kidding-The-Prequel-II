# Software Development Plan

## Administrivia

* Meeting details: We will meet tuesday and thursday after class (12:20pm) as needed. Depending on availability these times and dates can be changed.

## Development Methodology

* We are using an Agile-esque - We have issues registered on github, which just all of the features or functions we need to implement. The issues get assigned to individuals in what we are thinking of as individual sprints. This allows each member to have drastically different schedules of contribution, and allows for the fact that we have not mastered estimating how long jobs will take. Each member makes a new branch when they start on an assigned issue, and then when finished they submit it for merge with main, and it gets checked over and tested by at least 2 other members of the team. Everyone works together on deciding what features to implement, or how to approach any major design dicisions that affect the whole project.

## Roles

* Definitions:

    * Project Manager (PM): Everyone occupies this role. Decides what functions the project will have, sets an MVP and stretch goals.

    * Docudementor:  Is a servant for the team. Keeps meeting short and on topic and writes the details of meetings in an entry loacted in the `minute-meetings` folder.

    * Developer (Dev): Every member of our team will occupy this role. Responsible for building the actual product and meeting deadlines for deliverables. Will work on the functionality of the project.

    * Product Owner (PO): Responsible for defining and prioritizing product backlog and aligning the team to work on the most valuable features.

    * Quality Assurance (QA): Every member of our team will be fulfilling this role. Converts project requirements into tests and assures proper process adherence. Reviews and approves significant changes to the project.  

## Team Member Roles

*These roles are not set in stone and due to the small team size team members might need to occupy other roles*
