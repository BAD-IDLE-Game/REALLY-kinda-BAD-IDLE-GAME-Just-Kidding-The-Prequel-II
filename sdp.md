# Software Development Plan

## Administrivia
* Meeting details: By default, every tuesday and thursday after class (12:20pm) we will meet for approximately 30 minutes to 2 hours. Depending on availability these times and dates can be changed. 

## Development Methodology
* Agile - We will develop the project through an iterative approach. Each iterative cycle will be comprised on collaborative sprints. Each sprint will be include these general steps: Planning, design, developing, testing, deploying, and then review. We will repeat this process until each implementation for the project has been fully developed and tested. 

## Roles
* Definitions:
    * Project Manager: Everyone occupies this role to some degree and decides what each task they'll work on. These decisions will be made on an personal basis (for individual tasks), or a group basis for collaborative tasks (project managers duties overlaps withs functional manager and team leader in our group).

    * Scrum Master:  Is a servant for the team. Keeps meeting short and on topic and writes teh details of meeting in an entry loacted the `minute-meetings` folder.

    * Developer: Everyone member of our team will occupy this role. Responsible for building the actual product and meeting deadlines for deliverables. Will work on the functionality of the project.

    * Product Owner: Responsible for defining and prioritizing product backlog and aligning the team to work on the most valuable features.

    * Quality Assurance: Converts project requiremenst into tests and assures proper process adherence. Reviews and approves significant changes to the project.  

## Team Member Roles:
**Everyone occupies the developer roles.**
**These roles are not set in stone and due to the small team size team members might need to occupy other roles**

* Adiren Abbey: Product owner 
* Brandon Walker: Project manager
* Muhammed Abushamma: Scrum Master
* Luke Davidson: Quality Assurance 

## Milestones
