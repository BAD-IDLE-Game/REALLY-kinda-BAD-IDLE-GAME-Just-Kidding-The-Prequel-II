# Player Character
- Every player creates a character, for which progress is saved.
## Class
- Class-based or Classless?
	- Class Idea: 
		- Choose a race (determines base stats and stat growth)
		- Choose a weapon type (influenced by race selection)
		- Class is automatically determined (labeled) by this combination.
		- Ex: Human with Sword + Shield = Fighter.  Elf + Bow = Ranger.
- Chosen at creation, or unlocked at a certain level?
- Locked after chosen, or changable?
## Stats
- Character levels, or leveless design?
	- Determines where emphasis of game design is.
	- Leveless leaves all "progression" to be determined by stats and equipment.
	- Leveled allows for simpler balancing
- Primary stats?
	- Strength (damage multiplier?)
	- Dexterity (chance to hit/dodge?)
	- Constitution (determines hitpoints and regen rate?)
## Skills
- Talent tree?
	- More complicated, but more "normal"
- List of skills, each with a skill level?
	- Ex: Sword, Block, Dodge, Endurance, etc.
	- Skill levels could unlock "actions"
	- Lends more favorably with classless and/or levelless systems
	- Opens possibility of possibly doing "everything", giving a long-term goal for players
- Magic system, or typical low-fantasy stuff?
## Inventory
- Do characters have equipment?
	- What equipment slots, if any?
	- Do characters have an inventory system for unequipped items?
	- What does equipment provide?  Simple bonuses to stats?
### A very basic equipment system idea:
- Equipment provides a simple, flat bonus based on equipment type:
	- Weapons determine base damage
	- Armor determines damage reduction
- Equipment automatically upgrades as "loot" is found or crafted.
- This leaves open the opportunity to implement a proper inventory system
## Quests
- Very basic introductory quests to direct players in how to play the game.
- Basic long-term goals with rewards (giving directed progression)
- This  open the door for more interesting quest implementation later, which could introduce lore and stories.
## Activities
- A system where the players decide what their character does over a period of time.
- Lets players direct character progression.  Examples:
	- Explore (find new activities or locations)
	- Delve (enter a dungeon for combat and loot)
	- Train (increase certain skills or stats much faster)
	- Craft (create better equipment)
# Implementation Ideas
- Minimize to system tray (optionally).
- Event log.  Be able to see what happened while minimized.
	- Events still happen in real-time when running.
	- It's an idle game.  It plays itself (sorta).
