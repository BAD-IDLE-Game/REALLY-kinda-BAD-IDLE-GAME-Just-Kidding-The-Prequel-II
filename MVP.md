# Minimal Viable Product

Work in progress.  Based on whiteboard notes, Jan. 16, 2024

## UI

- Multi-window UI.  Bring it back into style.
- Permanent disclaimer window, always on top, disable minimize/close.
  - People should know what they've gotten themselves into, and the risks involved.

## Combat

- Dice roll for hit
- Back and forth
- Gear adds bonus for Combat
- If `HP=0`, you have to rest.
- Return button
- Group combat.
  - New window for *each* enemy being fought.  Fighting 5 enemies means 5 seperate windows.
  - Rare encounters with *lots* of enemies.  Really push modern hardware to the limits!

## Gear

- Weapon
- Armor
- Special / Accessory
- Find gear throughout adventure

- Base stats (names of stats likely to change):
  - Muscle
  - Brain
  - Humors?
- Character status
  - Boolean `isBattleReady`
  - Timer to track how long before combat ready after injury
- Currency system

## World / Map

- Single dungeon to start
  - Implement more as time permits
- Dungeons require set number of battles before facing the boss.
- Shop / Town
