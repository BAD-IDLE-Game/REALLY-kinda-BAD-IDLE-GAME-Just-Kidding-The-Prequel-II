# REALLY (kinda) BAD IDLE GAME (Just Kidding) The Prequel II

> Or RKBIGJKTP2 for short

## TO-DO

1. Submit Team names
2. ~~Make Github Repo and have everyone clone~~
3. Pick a “theme”.  Suggestion: try Kingdom of Loathing for thematic ideas.
4. Decide on complexity.  Suggestion: look at Progress Quest for a very “simple” start.
5. Use this to replace the google docs version? or maybe just use google docs form as our purposely terrible format goofy thing for presentation.

## Ideas to be expanded

* The player's idle progress could be calculated by tracking their starting time, active Jobs, and end time. When they start again we track the time and calculate what would have been gained.

## Topics to be Researched

* Save files?

## Features to be implemented

* Progress bar (what kinds?)
* Map (what purpose does this serve?)
* Skilltree (does this mean skills, or just incremental stat increases?)
* Crafting?
* Inventory?

## Starting timeline ideas

* Main menu
* Character creation (Name and stuff)
* Skill Tree
* Idle process
* Returning Log/Idle calculations

## STRETCH Goals

* 2nd Mode(Interactive)
* Party of character
* Server, Web Interface
* Friends, Parties
* Live dungeon feature
* Thesaurus feature
* Presentation mode
* Downgrades
    * Debt Traps
* Art Mode
* Cheat Codes
