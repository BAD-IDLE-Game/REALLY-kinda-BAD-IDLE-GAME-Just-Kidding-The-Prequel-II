## Preface
This github repo contains the project deliverables, source code, and documentation used in accordance and completion of the course CEG4110 - Introduction to Software Engineering taken at Wright State University during the Spring 2024 semester.

## Synopsis
This project is focused on creating an fantasy idle game loosely inspired by Melvor Idle and Kingdom of Loathing. This idle game will include various components of gameplay such as an idle combat system, player progression, saving/loading, and world map. Some stretch goals include crafting, inventory, a leveling system, and skill mechanisms. The creation of this game was done to practice the software developent process and methodology. We used a method similar to agile during the development of this project. The specifics of the method used is described in the software development plan (sdp.md) document.

## Note: 

### About the Game Name
B.A.D. Idle Game: B.A.D. is a recursive acronym with multiple interpretations. At its core, it humorously stands for "B.A.D. at Development," a tongue-in-cheek nod to the game's intentionally quirky design and rough edges. Alternatively, it can represent various aspects of the game, such as "Buy, Automate, Dominate" to highlight its economic features, "Battle and Develop" for strategic growth, or "Beasts and Dungeons" for a fantasy twist. Other interpretations include "Barely Adequate Design," and "Barely Active Dynamics," reflecting the challenges we faced with using outdated Java UI framworks while developing the game.

### About the Team Name
The B.A.D. Devs: B.A.D. can similarly be interpreted as a recursive acronym meaning "B.A.D. at Development", emphasizing the humor in embracing imperfections and acknowledging that development is often a messy, iterative process. This name reflects the team’s willingness to experiment, fail, and learn from mistakes—because, after all, even the best developers are "B.A.D." at something at some point in their journey. Alternatively, it could stand for "Breakthrough App Developers", emphasizing the team’s knack for pushing boundaries, "Brilliant Application Designers", highlighting the team's creative vision and skill, or "Better App Development", showcasing the team’s constant drive to improve and innovate.
