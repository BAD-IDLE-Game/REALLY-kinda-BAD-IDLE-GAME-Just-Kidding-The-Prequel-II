# REALLY (kinda) BAD IDLE GAME (Just Kidding) The Prequel II

> Or RKBIGJKTP2 for short

## Preface
This github repo contains the project deliverables, source code, and documentation used in accordance and completion of the course CEG4110 - Introduction to Software Engineering taken at Wright State University during the Spring 2024 semester.

## Synopsis
This project is focused on creating an fantasy idle game loosely inspired by Melvor Idle and Kingdom of Loathing. This idle game will include various components of gameplay such as an idle combat system, player progression, saving/loading, and world map. Some stretch goals include crafting, inventory, a leveling system, and skill mechanisms. The creation of this game was done to practice the software developent process and methodology. We used a method similar to agile during the development of this project. The specifics of the method used is described in the software development plan (sdp.md) document.
