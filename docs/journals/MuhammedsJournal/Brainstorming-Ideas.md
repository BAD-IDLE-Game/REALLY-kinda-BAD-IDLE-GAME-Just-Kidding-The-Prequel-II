**Don't start developing ANYTHING unless a clear plan of what the finished product looks like is created.**

*Implementation of ideas are tentative and can be changed to whatever later*

## Brainstorming Ideas:
1. Have the dungeon button be renamed to "Conquest" or "Explore". Clicking the button takes you to the "Conquest" screen where the player can choose which area to go to.
   - Can still have an area called the "dungeon" that has all monsters that infinitely loops. Button for the dungeon can still be located in the world, it just won't be unlocked until after completing the "main story" in the "Explore" tab is completed.
   - Main story should only take 20-30 minutes to complete. Story is more interactive than after games completion, so it should be short since this is an idle game. The dungeon will just be a mindless loop of combat, while combat areas in the story mode will have enemies interacting with you, lets the player make decisions, have somewhat of a cohesive storyline, etc.

2. The conquest screen will have a silhouette of each area, the player will need to unlock the first before the second and so on and so on. When one area is unlocked the silhouette disappears and shows what the area looks like.

3. The loading screen to the conquest screen will have a font animation of a knight walking with a sfx of walking on grass. Animation should be smooth and realistic. Have the knight trudge along and thud against each step.

4. Implement different books in the library like a lore book (will be labeled as a history book in-game), books with poems/gags, ones with excerpts of novels that were written in the game by NPCs about the human condition, etc.

5. Once the player enters the library tab, that will unlock a dialogue option in the tavern for Markus or Aaron to teach you how to read. Will cost 50-175-300-425-550 gold (scales with level from levels 1-5, player starts at level 0) per lesson. Lesson 1 costs 50 gold and increases by 125 gold per lesson. Level 5 is the max level and the player will be able to read any book in the library.

6. Reading books that have a higher literacy rating than your current reading level will make the words in the book jumbled and misspelled. The closer the player gets to the literacy rate of the book the less scrambled the words will be. When the player gets to the exact reading level the words will be completely legible to the player. There'll be a warning and literacy level at the front of each book's page warning the player they need to increase their literacy level to read it. Something like "This book will be hard to read at your current reading level of <player's reading level>. Get reading lessons from someone in the tavern".
   - Here is a list of lvl for different books in the library:
     - Book of monsters - level 1 (can still be read pretty clearly at level 0, just take a little effort.)
     - Poems/lore/parables - level 2
     - Gags/joke books - level 3
     - Literary excerpts - level 4
     - ??? - level 5
   - Optional - maybe look into allowing the player learn different languages, like the hobo goblin or cyclopian language.

7. Incorporate the mandelbrot set somewhere, maybe make it a graphic somewhere, For instance can make it a transition screen between an area where you ingest a mushroom Before entering the area ask the player "Eat the mushroom?..." with the last dot blinking. Have a narrative beforehand that explains how the player got to the point of eating the mushroom. Have the transition be an animation of the mandelbrot set. Must generate the mandelbrot programmatically as a coding exercise.
   - After ingesting the mushroom the player will be transported to a psychedelic state, where the monsters will be zany and abstract.

8. Have the character status panel and combat log for combat zones be transparent (but font opaque for better visibility) so the background can be seen, and put them either in the bottom or lower left or right-hand side of the screen.

9. Explore more themes about the human condition, Give the player different moral and intellectual decisions and make them ask questions.

10. If the player has a level 3 potion belt or higher but hasn't purchased a homestead yet, an NPC will scold them in the tavern by saying "You have such a luxurious potion belt. What? You don't have a homestead? Aren't keen on making wise financial decisions, I see." Once the player owns a homestead the dialogue option will go away.

11. Have a start screen or hobo goblin (indicate in his design which goblin he exactly is, like a certain color or blue hobo sack) They will tumble down a steep hill repeatedly in the background of the hobo village. At the top of the hill, there is a house that is impossible to get to. After defeating 20 hobogoblins a dialogue option is unlocked in the tavern that says something like: "Have you seen the hobo goblin who keeps trying to get to homestead on top of the cliff?" "The one that keeps trying over and over again but to no avail?" "Yes, that's the one. One must imagine him happy. " "Why's that?" "You'd have to ask him, if goblins could speak English that is."
   - If the player has completed the hobo village and has a level 1 in hobospeak, going back to the hobo village the player will have a 1/10 chance of encountering the special hobo goblin, after defeating him, you ask him why do you continue to climb up the hill? He will say "Its in my nature to walk this world searching for a place to stay, I have found meaning in the act of searching itself". If the player has a level 2 hobospeak you can persuade him to come to your homestead and he will accept, now appearing somewhere in your homestead.

12. Player can create gold through alchemy by turning piss into gold. [what-we-ve-gained-from-the-alchemist-who-tried-to-turn-pee-into-gold](https://www.mgsrefining.com/blog/what-we-ve-gained-from-the-alchemist-who-tried-to-turn-pee-into-gold/)

13. The tavern will now have a "Buy <NPC-name> a drink - 10 gold" --- "Talk to another townsfolk" --- "Leave" Buying him a drink will continue the conversation, the player will have some predetermined lines of dialogue such as asking "why" or "Go on".

14. You have the ability to show mercy or kill the grand leader of the hobo goblins, before giving this chance to the player the leader will have a couple of dialogue lines basically saying "Leader of the hobogoblin appears". He says "I will avenge my village". You say "You can speak English?". You fight, beat him, leader explains himself and explains how he can speak, you can either kill him or show mercy, if you spare him he appears in your homestead and can give you lessons in hobospeak. Also will tell you the amount of hobohoblins you have killed in the game so far.

15. Can have a cooldown on talking will people in the tavern, like you can sleep in your homestead or wait 5 minutes while in-game. So the player can only go to the tavern and speak every so often, will make the feature more exclusive and implicitly communicate to the player that the tavern has some important/interesting features.

16. Have the irl date and time for save and load files.

17. Homestead screen will have two buttons, an inventory and walk around button. The walk around button will take you to another screen that will have three buttons in the top, left, and right-hand sides, on the button is the walk back button. The three buttons will be alchemy, craft, and cook. These screens will be procedurally generated from the same source they look like you are continuously walking through your homestead. Top button will be "keep walking" will take you to another panel with three more buttons, one for talking with monsters, people you've hired to maintain your homestead, etc. Can purchase farmhands to automatically farm for you, even while outside of game. 

18. Have a story about how a group of cyclopians that are stuck in a cave, similar to Plato's allegory of the cave.

19. Have another story of two groups warring over land and the player must choose a side to align with.

20. Parables used so far: Sisyphus, Plato's allegory of the cave, futility, meaning, human condition, homelessness, ethics, war, mercy... - (try to incorporate different mystic/philosophical parables, like the Sufi story of the three fishes or stories by Rumi. [Story of the Three Fishes](https://the.ismaili/portugal/two-sufi-tales-2). [sufi stories](https://riyaazqawwali.com/sufi-stories/))

   ```
   Eplanation of the story of the three fishes:
   The story of three fishes is a story from the Panchatantra that teaches children about wisdom, 
   intelligence, and the value of time. The story is about three fish: the first is wise and 
   thoughtful, the second is intelligent and resourceful, and the third is lazy and believes 
   in fate. The moral of the story is to act quickly when you see trouble and to be alert and
   have a presence of mind.
   ```
   
20. It will be too difficult to incorporate large amounts of story into the idle combat, so the best way to do it is to have most of the story be told through stories in the library, then give nods to it in the background or 1-2 lines of diagoue while fighting,
	
21. Before incorporating any aspects of story of parables first make sure the actual gameplay is fun. Make combat, harvesting, farming, crafting etc. all fun to do. 

22. Story can be disseminated through a similar way Tales of Maj'Eyal handles lore. Lore us randomly found while playing, which allows players to find out more about the world without requiring rigid story line mechanics or distracting from the core gameplay loop.
