# Brandon's Journal

Filled in the attack function, function for drinking potions. Made a basic gear class and some assorted fields to the player character. Added classes for all of the classes declared on the class diagram.

Making a garbage GUI to test functionality as its added.

Made my really terrible start screen.

Added a barely functional placeholder character creation and world map, with buttons to make them able to interact with their needed features for testing.

Realized we need a seperate class that manages all the interface screen to help clean up code and make later adjustments easier, dreading it, but also getting working on it.
