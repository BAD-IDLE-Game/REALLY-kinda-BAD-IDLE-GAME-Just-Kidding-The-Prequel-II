# Meeting Minutes
**Date:** 3/22/24

## Agenda
1. **Theme**: We have a mix of themes.  Which do we keep?  Which do we adjust?
2. **Game name is still hotly contested**.  This will be fixed, regardless of Luke's efforts.
3. **Update documentation with new features?**
4. **Consolidate plans**: We need to agree to how to proceed, and work towards a common target.
5. **Presentation is April 11th**.  

## Notes
1. **Theme**: keeping what we're doing, mix of MS Paint and AI generated.  But with more googley eyes.  Also for the presentation?
2. **Game name is no longer hotly contested.**  Luke lost.  He just doesn't know it yet.
3. **Documentation still needs updating.**  Briefly mentioned, then forgotten.  Maybe.  We have meeting notes though.
4. **Consolidate plans**:
	- Code Freeze on Apr. 5!  Aim for MVP goals.
	- Have our individual work done by Mar. 29.
	- Following week is reserved for testing, balancing, and debugging.
5. **Presentation**: 
	- It's happening.  
	- Luke is focusing on this.  
	- He brilliantly shared an editable Google Drive link.  
		- We will abuse this to ensure the game title is the best.
