Lore: 
Can have an overarching lore we can document and keep track for ourselves in a lore.md file. The player will get the lore indirectly, through things like the library or tavern by reading books and talking to townsfolk.

Mana: 
Mana is the magical essence passively emanated from living souls. 
When a living being dies their soul is forcibly removed from their body, emanating a burst of mana afterwords.
Trees and other plant life emit mana as well, for they are a part of the World's animate and sentient ecosystem.  
Even the rocks can emanate mana, for they too are a part of the World's ecosystem by housing small microbes and other
living creatures.
