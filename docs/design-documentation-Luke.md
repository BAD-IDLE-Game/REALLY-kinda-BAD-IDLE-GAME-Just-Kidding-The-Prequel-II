NOTE: This is intended to be merged with design documentation from the others working on this project!

# Design Specification Documenation
> This document should one for one describe how each requirement will be met through implementation details. Where appropriate provide graphics (e.g., mock-ups) that show what an interface should look like. In the coming days, we will also discuss different types of ways of describing interactions (e.g., data flow diagrams, swim lanes, sequence diagrams) which might be useful to include, as well.
